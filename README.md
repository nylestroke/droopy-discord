# JDA (Java Discord API)

JDA strives to provide a clean and full wrapping of the Discord REST api and its Websocket-Events for Java.
This library is a helpful tool that provides the functionality to create a discord bot in java.

## Summary

Due to official statements made by the Discord developers we will no longer support unofficial features. These features
are undocumented API endpoints or protocols that are not available to bot-accounts.

_Please see the [Discord docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference) for more information about bot accounts._
